2. SQL Server 2014 or later 
3. Cirrus Core Wallet (Hackathon Edition)

### Project Configuration
#### 1. Configure Database.

Open up the DB script from the root (`DBScript.sql`) and run it on your SQL server. It will create a new database `SignatureDB`, tables and required stored procedures.

#### 2. Configure Web Project.

Open up the `appsettings.json` file and update the `ConnectionString` and `ContractAddress`, then run the project.

### Modules

#### Registration & Login

Any user can register with the application by providing basic detail such as name, email, password and a valid wallet. Make sure the wallet has sufficient funds to make transactions.

**Awaiting My Sign:** Counts of documents remaining sign by the logged-in user. <br> 
**Completed:** Counts of documents signed by all the signers.

#### Contact

The application user can add other registered users in his/her contact list. These contacts will be displaying during document creation and can choose as signers.

This creation method will call the smart contract methods `CreateAgreement` and `AddSigners`.

#### Document Signing

A signer can sign the document from the detail page. This will sign the transaction and execute the `SignAgreement` function of the smart contract and stored signing information to the contract state.
